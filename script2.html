<h1>Script 2: (Color) Contrast Ratio</h1>
<p><a href="Overview.html">&lt; Scripts for Showcase Examples with Videos</a></p>

<p>Relate the issue to the personal experience of the reader/viewer, as most will have encountered a situation of illegible text. Emphasize that good choice of colors is good practice in addition to an accessibility requirement. Use the statistic "1 in 12 adult males" and age-related visual limitations to counter the myth that it is only about a small group of people impacted. Explain the additional benefits, especially for mobile use.</p>
