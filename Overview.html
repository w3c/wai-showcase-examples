		<h2 id="intro" class="no-display">Introduction</h2>
		<p>Web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities but useful for many more. Learn about some of the accessibility considerations and how they benefit everyone in different situations.</p>

		<h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard Compatibility</h2>
		<br /><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B92B0V8XvplMb01sUEtsMWJ1RXc/preview" width="360" height="240"></iframe><!--
		<video controls preload="metadata">

		  <track src="sample-en.vtt" label="English captions" kind="captions" srclang="en" default=""></track>
		  <p>Unfortunately, your browser does not support the video element. You may have more success with a more recent browser version</p>
		</video>-->
		<p>Websites, including forms and applications, need to support keyboard interaction. This allows them to be usable by people using on-screen (touch), ergonomic, and specialized keyboards, as well as by voice recognition. This is essential for many people with physical and visual disabilities who may not be able to use a mouse. It is also useful in many other circumstances, such as for people with injuries such as a broken arm or repetitive stress injuries (RSI). It also allows websites to be usable on public terminals (kiosks) without a mouse or when the mouse simply breaks. <a href="#learn">Learn more about web accessibility</a> - esential for some, useful for all.</p>

		<h2 id="contrast">Colors with Good Contrast</h2>
		<br /><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B92B0V8XvplMTkNKd0VNaGxtRmM/preview" width="360" height="240"></iframe><!--
		<video controls preload="metadata">
		  <source src="sample.mp4" type="video/mp4">

		  <p>Unfortunately, your browser does not support the video element. You may have more success with a more recent browser version</p>
		</video>-->
		<p>Many people have difficulty distinguishing certain colors, or perceive them differently. Ensuring adequate contrast between foreground and background colors of text, links, icons, and buttons allows websites to be usable by many more people. This is essential for people with disabilities, such as people with age-related contrast sensitivity. It is also useful for people in different circumstances, such as changing lighting conditions and glar, especially on mobile devices. <a href="#learn">Learn more about web accessibility</a> - esential for some, useful for all.</p>

		<h2 id="layout">Clear Layout and Design</h2>
		<br /><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B92B0V8XvplMX3NIQ2Nqd2R6TXM/preview" width="360" height="240"></iframe><!--
		<video controls preload="metadata">

		  <p>Unfortunately, your browser does not support the video element. You may have more success with a more recent browser version</p>
		</video>-->
		<p>Clear layout and design helps people navigate and find content more easily. Particularly website forms and applications can be complex and confusing. Yet clear layout and design is essential for people with low vision who may only be seeing a small portion of the screen at a time, and for people with cogntivie and learning disabilities who often need clarity and consistency to orient themselves on a website. It is also useful for many more, in particular to people who are new to the website or new to computers altogether. Also for people who may be viewing the website on a small computer screen, such as on a mobile device, or may be in a hurry to find the right information. <a href="#learn">Learn more about web accessibility</a> - esential for some, useful for all.</p>

		<h2 id="areas">Large Select Areas</h2>
		<br /><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B92B0V8XvplMS2FtNHJyUVJMUEU/preview" width="360" height="240"></iframe><!--
		<video controls preload="metadata">
		  <source src="sample.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		  <track src="sample-en.vtt" label="English captions" kind="captions" srclang="en" default=""></track>
		  <p>Unfortunately, your browser does not support the video element. You may have more success with a more recent browser version</p>
		</video>-->
		<p>Small links, buttons, checkboxes, and other form elements are difficult to use by almost everyone. This includes clicking them by mouse or tapping them on touch screens. Providing sufficent select areas is essential for people with reduced dexterity, such as physical disabilities and tremors due to age. It is useful for people with injuries, such as repetitive stress injuries (RSI), and temporary limited mobility, such as a bandaged arm. It also allows the website to be usable on small screens, especially on mobile devices while moving around. <a href="#learn">Learn more about web accessibility</a> - esential for some, useful for all.</p>

		<h2 id="captions">Video Captions</h2>
		<br /><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B92B0V8XvplMMWR5dDB2S0wwVk0/preview" width="360" height="240"></iframe><!--
		<video controls preload="metadata">

		  <p>Unfortunately, your browser does not support the video element. You may have more success with a more recent browser version</p>
		</video>-->
		<p>Video captions are essential for people who are deaf and also for people who cannot hear certain audio. They are also used by people with cognitive and learning disabilities, such as some forms of dyselxia, to see and hear the content to better understand it. Captions are useful for people who are not fluent in the language, and make video usable in loud and quite environments. They also support search-engine indexing, especially when they are accompanied by transcripts. <a href="#learn">Learn more about web accessibility</a> - esential for some, useful for all.</p>

		<h2 id="customization">Customizable Text</h2>
		<br /><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B92B0V8XvplMWDJlNmpJTThlTlk/preview" width="360" height="240"></iframe><!--

		  <p>Unfortunately, your browser does not support the video element. You may have more success with a more recent browser version</p>
		</video>-->
		<p>Being able to change the size, spacing, font, and colors of text is essential for many people with low vision and dyslexia. It is also useful for everyone who prefers particular presentation of text, especially for longer articles and content. This also allows content to reflow better on different window and screen sizes, and make it more usable across different devices. Text customization needs support by both the website and the web browser. <a href="#learn">Learn more about web accessibility</a> - esential for some, useful for all.</p>

		<h2 id="speech">Text to Speech</h2>
		<br /><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B92B0V8XvplMWUlBLXE1RklYQjA/preview" width="360" height="240"></iframe><!--

		  <p>Unfortunately, your browser does not support the video element. You may have more success with a more recent browser version</p>
		</video>-->
		<p>Letting the computer read aloud what is on the screen is an essential function for people with visual disabilities. It is also used by people with cognitive and learning disabilities, such as some forms of dyslexia, to see and hear the content to better understand it. Meanwhile this functionality is available for everyone on most computers and mobile devices. It is useful for people who prefer to listen rather than read, who cannot look at the screen, or just like to multi-task. Websites need to be properly coded to support text to speech. <a href="#learn">Learn more about web accessibility</a> - esential for some, useful for all.</p>

		<h2 id="voice">Voice Recognition</h2>
		<br /><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B92B0V8XvplMVE10UllnQ3h6VGc/preview" width="360" height="240"></iframe><!--

		</video>-->
		<p>Today most computers and mobile devices can be used through voice, rather than by typing and clicking. Voice recognition technology is essential for people with physical disabilties who have difficulty using the keyboard and mouse. It is also useful for people with injuries such as a broken arm or repetitive stress injuries (RSI), or who are using mobile devices on the go. Websites need to be properly coded to support voice recognition. <a href="#learn">Learn more about web accessibility</a> - esential for some, useful for all.</p>

		<h2 id="understandable">Understandable Content</h2>

		<p>Avoiding overly complex language, jargon, and acronyms, and providing structures using headings, lists, and separation is a fundamental aspect of making content understandable. This is essential for many people with disabilities, in particular people with certain forms of cognitive and learning disabilities. It is also useful for many more, such as non-native speakers and people with lower literacy. <a href="#learn">Learn more about web accessibility</a> - esential for some, useful for all.</p>

		<h2 id="notifications">Notifications and Feedback</h2>
		<br /><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B92B0V8XvplMQnVwZl9aZWtVakU/preview" width="360" height="240"></iframe><!--

		  <p>Unfortunately, your browser does not support the video element. You may have more success with a more recent browser version</p>
		</video>-->
		<p>Website forms and applications can be particularly confusing for many people. Ensuring appropriate notifications and feedback, such as understandable instructions and error messages, is essential for people with disabilities, in particular people with certain forms of cognitive and learning disabilities. It is also useful for many more, such as non-native speakers, people with lower literacy, and people who are new to computers. <a href="#learn">Learn more about web accessibility</a> - esential for some, useful for all.</p>
